During the last few weeks, my TomTom Live 825M Europe was extremely slow in finding the GPS location.

Sometimes more than 15 minutes, which is totally unacceptable.
TomTom support proposed to bring the device up-to-date, which I already did without better results.

The "drum roll reset" as proposed on a few forums as a solution for other issues, solved all problems!
Hold the power button for up to 30 seconds until you here the drum roll.
A GPS location lock is now achieved in a few seconds after power on.
